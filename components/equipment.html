            <h2>3. Digital X-Ray for Safe and Accurate Imaging</h2>
            <p>Our digital X-ray technology provides high-resolution images with significantly reduced radiation
                exposure compared to conventional X-rays. This allows us to diagnose and monitor dental conditions
                accurately while prioritizing patient safety.

            <h2>4. 3D CT Scan for Detailed Diagnosis and Treatment Planning</h2>
            <p>We use a 3D CT scanner that generates comprehensive, three-dimensional images of your teeth, jawbone, and
                surrounding structures. This technology is essential for planning complex procedures, such as implant
                placement and bone grafting, ensuring accurate treatment and optimal results.

            <p>Our intraoral camera allows for a close-up view of your mouth, enabling our team to show you detailed
                images of your dental condition. This helps us explain your treatment options clearly, making sure you
                are informed and confident throughout your dental journey.

            <h2>6. Ultrasonic Scaler for Efficient and Comfortable Teeth Cleaning</h2>
            <p>Our ultrasonic scaler gently removes tartar and plaque from your teeth using ultrasonic vibrations. It
                provides a deep clean below the gum line, supporting gum health and leaving your teeth feeling refreshed
