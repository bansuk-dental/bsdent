      </div>
      <div class="content1-cards">
        <div class="card1">
          <h2>Specialist in Dental Conservation and Endodontics</h2>
          <p>
            A Dental Conservation Specialist, often referred to as an Endodontist, focuses on preserving
            natural teeth through advanced techniques aimed at maintaining the integrity and health of the
            tooth structure. Unlike general dentists who provide a broad range of dental care, or other
            dental specialists who may focus on surgical or cosmetic procedures, a dental conservation
            specialist is dedicated to saving and restoring natural teeth, even in complex cases.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card1">
          <h2>Advanced Expertise in Saving Natural Teeth</h2>
          <p>
            With years of specialized training beyond general dentistry, conservation specialists use
            state-of-the-art techniques, such as root canal therapy, to treat damaged or infected teeth and
            prevent extractions. Their advanced expertise allows them to address deep-rooted dental issues,
            preserving teeth that might otherwise be removed.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="content1-cards">
        <div class="card1">
          <h2>Focus on Long-Term Dental Health and Minimally Invasive Procedures</h2>
          <p>
            Endodontists prioritize long-term dental health by employing minimally invasive procedures
            that focus on the natural structure of each tooth. This approach minimizes patient discomfort and
            ensures that treatments are designed for durability and longevity, protecting the original teeth
            whenever possible.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card1">
          <h2>Precision and Pain Management for Complex Cases</h2>
          <p>
            A dental conservation specialist is skilled in handling complex cases involving the tooth's
            inner structures (such as the pulp and nerves), often using advanced imaging technologies for
            accurate diagnosis and treatment. With a keen focus on patient comfort, they are experts in pain
            management, making the process as seamless as possible.
